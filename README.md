# Dirt-samples

- any `*k` suffix folder will contain kicks
- any `*s` suffix folder will contain snares
- any `*h` suffix folder will contain hats
- any `*p` suffix folder will contain percs
- any `*f` suffix folder will contain foleys or various noises
- any `*c` suffix folder will contain claps

Made for my own use + 2Mo with Tidalcycles / SuperDirt, but feel free to use them

Usual and painless location on a Debian or \*ubuntu derivative  is `~/.local/share/SuperCollider/downloaded-quarks/Dirt-Samples/`, increase the buffer and memory size in your SuperCollider startup file or SuperDirt options, if needed

Most likely stereo, 44.1 KHz 16 bit, fits your hardware sampler if needed

- If you plan to use the [_**tidal-autocode**_](https://github.com/kindohm/tidal-autocode) Atom package, here's a snippet I paste in `Packages > Tidal Autocode > Settings > Samples` (adapt to your own samples, see below) :

- A basic trick is to create a .txt file from a rep in CL:

> `$ ls ~/.local/share/SuerCollider/downloaded-quarks/Dirt-Samples/ > ~/Location/Filename.txt`

Then edit it in Atom: from the second word, select all (`Ctrl + A`), go to `Selection > Split into lines`, go to `Selection > Select to beginning of line`, type a comma and a space, go to `Selection > Select to beginning of line` again (or this time you could use the Page begin button), delete the line return so that you get a huge text line, compoare to the formatting above, and voil√†.
