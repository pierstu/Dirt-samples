Made for my own use + 2Mo with Tidalcycles / SuperDirt, but feel free to use them

Usual and hassleless location on a Debian or \*ubuntu derivative  is `~/.local/share/SuperCollider/downloaded-quarks/Dirt-Samples/`, increase the buffer and memory size in your SuperCollider startup file or SuperDirt options, if needed

Most likely stereo, 44.1 KHz 16 bit, fits your hardware sampler if needed
